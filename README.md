# colorado-education
Web app for working with Colorado education data

## Architecture
This web application will [eventually] use the following technologies
* Angular 6/7
* D3.js
* GraphQL
* Python
* MongoDB
* containerd
* Kubernetes
* CI/CD

## Goals
This application is a portal for CSAP and TCAP standardized testing results. This application will initially display and track trends of public grade school performance of students in Colorado in the year of 2014. Afterward, the application will allow ingestion of similarly structured datasets, but for different years. After that, the application will attempt to generalize for data from other state public school systems.
